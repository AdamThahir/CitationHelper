## _The script to help you plagiarize references from published journals._

Uses Ragex and Selenium to find BibTeX versions of multiple citations found within a journal article.

The sample article used was a two-columned article having citations in the IEEE format.

Replace the contents found in `citations.txt` with the citations you would like to lookup.

Run:
```
$ python main.py
```

> Note: After a certain number of scans, you are very likely to run into Google's Human verification, which I have not found a way around yet.
